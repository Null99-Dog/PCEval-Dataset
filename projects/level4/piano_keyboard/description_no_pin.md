# Piano Keyboard

## Project Description
This is an Arduino project that creates a piano keyboard using four push buttons and four buzzers corresponding to the notes Do, Re, Mi, and Fa.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Push Button * 4
- 10kΩ resistor * 4
- Piezoelectric Buzzer * 4

## Circuit Description
Four piezo buzzers and four push buttons are connected to an Arduino Uno. Button 1 and Buzzer 1 correspond to the note Do, Button 2 and Buzzer 2 to Re, Button 3 and Buzzer 3 to Mi, and Button 4 and Buzzer 4 to Fa. Buttons 1 through 4 are connected to Arduino digital pins and connected to ground through 10kΩ resistor. Buttons uses pull-down resistor configuration.  
The positive pins of the buzzers are connected to Arduino digital pins.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Configure button pins as INPUT
2. Configure buzzer pins as OUTPUT
3. Continuously monitor the button state, and if it reads HIGH, play a tone on the corresponding buzzer
4. If no button is pressed, keep all buzzers silent

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. The buzzer plays a tone when the corresponding button is pressed.

## Notes for Implementation
- The button input will read HIGH when it is pressed.
- When the button is not pressed, pin1.l is connected to pin1.r and pin2.l is connected to pin2.r. When the button is pressed, all the pins are connected together.
- The frequencies of Do, Re, Mi, and Fa are 262 Hz, 294 Hz, 330 Hz, and 349 Hz, respectively.
- Only one button is pressed at a time.

## Attributes
- To use 10kΩ resistor, set the property name "value" to "10000 ohm".
