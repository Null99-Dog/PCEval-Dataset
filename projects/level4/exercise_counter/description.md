# Exercise Counter

## Project Description
This is a motion counter that detects movement with an MPU6050 gyroscope and displays the count on a 1-digit 7-segment display, made with arduino uno.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- 7-segment display
- 220Ω resistor * 7
- MPU6050 6-axis Accel & Gyro Sensor

## Circuit Description
A 7-segment display and a mpu6050 sensor is connected to arduino uno. Pin A to G is connected to arduino pin 2 to 8 through 220Ω resistor, respectively. Common pin of 7-segment is connected to gnd2. For mpu6050 sensor, VCC and GND pin is connected to arduino 5v and gnd2 pin. SCL pin and SDA pin is connected to arduino pin A5 and A4.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Set pins for 7-segments as OUTPUT
2. Check the connection of mpu6050
3. Display number 0 on the 7-segment display
4. Continuously read the Y rotation value of mpu6050
5. The count increases when the Y-axis rotation value exceeds 15000, and it does not increase again until the absolute value drops below 2000
6. Continuously display the count on the 7-segment display

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. The count increases only when the absolute Y-axis rotation value rises above 15000 after previously dropping below 2000.
2. The current count is correctly displayed on the 7-segment display.

## Notes for Implementation
- Use MPU6050.h, Wire.h libraries.
- MPU6050 has I2C interface.

## Attributes
- To use 220Ω resistor, set the property name "value" to "220 ohm".
