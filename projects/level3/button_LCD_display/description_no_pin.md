# LCD Display with Button

## Project Description
This is an Arduino project that shows button state to the ili9341 lcd display.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ili9341 LCD Display
- Push Button
- 10kΩ resistor

## Circuit Description
Ili9341 LCD Display and push button are connected to the Arudino Uno board. RST, D/C, CS, MOSI, MISO, SCK pin of LCD display is connected to arduino digital pins. The push button is configured in a cathode-style circuit.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Declare Adafruit_ILI9341 object
2. Begin display and change it to landscape mode, and set the text color to white, and size to 2
3. Set button pin as INPUT, and countinuosly read the button state
4. If the button is newly pressed, clear the display with a black background and print the test "Pressed! at position (0, 0)
5. ELse, clear the display with a black background and print the test "Not pressed! at position (0, 0)

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Button state is successfully printed to the display, with correct position, color, and size.

## Notes for Implementation
- Use the following libraries: <SPI.h>, <Adafruit_GFX.h>, and <Adafruit_ILI9341.h>.
- When the button is not pressed, pin1.l is connected to pin1.r and pin2.l is connected to pin2.r. When the button is pressed, all the pins are connected together.
