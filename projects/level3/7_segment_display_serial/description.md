# One Digit 7-segment Display With Serial Input

## Project Description
This is an Arduino project that show the serial input with digit 7-segment display.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- 330Ω resistor * 8
- 7-segment display

## Circuit Description
Circuit is designed to use a 7-segment display. The 7-segment display is a common anode type, so the common pin is connected to 5V. The A to G and DP pins are connected to Arduino digital pins 2 to 9 through 330-ohm resistors.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Set 2~9 pin as an output.
2. Continuously check if the serial is available.
3. Taking into account that the display is common anode, set the corresponding pins to HIGH or LOW so that the serial input is shown on the 7-segment display.

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. The 7-segment display shows the same value as the serial input.

## Notes for Implementation
- The 7-segment display is a common anode type.

## Variants
This project may have different variants with the segment pins connected to the different pins.

## Attributes
- To use 330Ω resistor, set the property name "value" to "330 ohm".
