# Potentiometer Bar LED

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that controls bar graph LED with a potentiometer.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Bar graph LED
- 220Ω resistor * 10
- Potentiometer

## Circuit Description
Anode pins 1~10 of bar graph LED are connected to arduino digital pins. The cathode pins 1 through 10 of the bar graph LED are connected to ground through 220kΩ resistors. The SIG pin of the potentiometer is connected to the arduino analog pin.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Set bar graph led pin modes as OUTPUT
2. Set potentiometer signal pin as INPUT
3. Continuously read the potentiometer value, which ranges from 0 to 1023, and map it to a range of 0 to 10
4. Turn on only the LEDs up to the mapped value, and turn off the rest.

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Anode of the bar LED pins whose number is smaller than the mapped value receive HIGH signals, while greater pins receive LOW signals.

## Notes for Implementation
- Potentiometer value ranges from 0 to 1023.

## Variants
This project may have different variants with the LED, potentiometer connected to different pins or using LEDs of different colors.

## Attributes
- To use 220Ω resistor, set the property name "value" to "220 ohm".
