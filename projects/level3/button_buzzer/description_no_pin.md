# Button Buzzer

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that uses pushbutton to control piezoelectric buzzer.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Piezoelectric buzzer
- Push Button
- 10kΩ resistor

## Circuit Description
Piezo buzzer and button are connected to the Arduino. The positive pin of buzzer is connected to arduino digital pin. The button uses a pull-up resistor configuration. The button is connected to power using 10kΩ resistor.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Set button pin to INPUT, and buzzer pin to OUTPUT
2. Continuously read the button value
3. If the button is pressed, play 262Hz tone

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Piezo buzzer runs when the button is pressed.
2. The piezo buzzer doesn’t sound when the button is not pressed.

## Notes for Implementation
- The button reads LOW when pressed and HIGH when not pressed.
- When the button is not pressed, pin1.l is connected to pin1.r and pin2.l is connected to pin2.r. When the button is pressed, all the pins are connected together.

## Variants
There may be variants with buzzer pin number, button pin number, and GND pin number.

## Attributes
- To use 10kΩ resistor, set the property name "value" to "10000 ohm".
