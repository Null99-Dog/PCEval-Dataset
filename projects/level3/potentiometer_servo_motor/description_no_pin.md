# Potentiometer Servo Motor

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that controls servo motor with a potentiometer.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Servo motor
- Potentiometer

## Circuit Description
The SIG pin of the potentiometer is connected to the arduino analog pin. The PWN pin of servo motor is connected to the arduino digital pin.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Generate Servo object
2. Set potentiometer signal pin a0 as INPUT
3. Continuously read the potentiometer value, which ranges from 0 to 1023, and map it to a range of 0 to 180
4. Write the mapped value to the servo motor
5. Continuously read the servo value and print it to the serial monitor 

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. The servo motor rotates correctly according to the mapped value from the potentiometer.

## Notes for Implementation
- Potentiometer value ranges from 0 to 1023.
- Servo motor value ranges from 0 to 180.

## Variants
This project may have different variants with the servo motor, potentiometer connected to different pins.
