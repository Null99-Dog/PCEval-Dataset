# Distance Sensor

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that uses Ultrasonic distance sensor to measure the distance.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor

## Circuit Description
The ultrasonic distance sensor is connected to the Arduino. The VCC pin is connected to 5V, the GND pin to gnd3, the TRIG pin to pin3, and the ECHO pin to pin2.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Initialize serial communication
2. Continuously trigger and read the Ultrasonic distance sensor
3. Change the value to the centimeter and print in the format: "Distance in CM: {value}"

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Correct distance value in centimeter is printed in the serial monitor.

## Notes for Implementation
- To convert the distance sensor value to centimeters, divide it by 58.

## Variants
There may be variants with init distance value and ECHO, TRIG, GND pin number.
