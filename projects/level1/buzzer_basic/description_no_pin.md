# Piezo Buzzer

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that uses piezoelectric buzzer to play 262Hz tone.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- Piezoelectric buzzer

## Circuit Description
The piezo buzzer is connected to the Arduino. The positive pin is connected to arduino digital pin.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Set the pin mode as OUTPUT
2. Continuously play 262Hz tone

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Piezo buzzer runs successfuly

## Notes for Implementation
- In the loop function, make buzzer play 262Hz tone

## Variants
There may be variants with buzzer, GND pin number and the pitch of the sound being played.
