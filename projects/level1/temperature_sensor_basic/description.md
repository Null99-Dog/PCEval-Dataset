# Temperature Sensor Basic

## Project Description
This is a simple Arduino project that uses dht22 sensor to measure the temperature.

## Hardware Components
- Arduino Uno
- DHT22 sensor

## Circuit Description
The DHT22 sensor is connected to an Arduino Uno. The VCC pin is connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino, and the GND pin is connected to the GND2 pin. The data pin is connected to digital pin 2 on the Arduino.

## Expected Behavior
When the Arduino powers up, it should:
1. Initialize serial monitor
2. Initialize and begin DHT sensor
3. Continuously read the DHT sensor's temperature value
4. Print temperature to the serial monitor in the following format: "Current temperature: {temperature value}", for example: "Current temperature: 40"

## Success Criteria
The test is successful when:
1. Correct temperature value in celsius is printed in the serial monitor.
